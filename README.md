# Sumo to Vision
Simulate perception sensors and object detection based on traffic data generated by Sumo.

# Data generation
1. Adjust the `path` value in `initialize_folders.py` at line 31 for the path to generate the data.
2. Run `initialize_folders.py` to generate the data.
3. To run all scenario (bulk run): Run `parallel_all_scenarios.py`.
4. Otherwise, run `sumo_visual_scenario.py` for generating data for a single scenario.

# Data format
1. Vehicle class (in vehicle_info.py) has the vehicle attached information.
2. The output files have the following format:
> (cv2x_vehicles, non_cv2x_vehicles, buildings, cv2x_perceived_non_cv2x_vehicles, scores_per_cv2x, los_statuses, vehicles,  cv2x_perceived_non_cv2x_vehicles, cv2x_vehicles_perception_visible, tot_perceived_objects, tot_visible_objects)
3. `cv2x_perceived_non_cv2x_vehicles` is a dictionary having the cv2x id as a key and the perceived vehicles as value.
